Revision history for GLPI Agent Monitor


New features/fixes for the future release

* Agent service control button added on main window
  This button controls the Agent service status. It is a single button
  that stops the service if it's running, starts if it's stopped
  and resumes the service if it's paused. Pause support wasn't
  added as it likely isn't necessary.
  Windows will ask for elevation to control the Agent service.

* Italian language added
  Thanks Kintaro Oe (@kintaro1981)

* Bugfix (#6): Fixed a bug which causes the Monitor to ignore
  HTTP URLs when clicking the "New ticket" button


1.1.0

* "New ticket" button added on main window and right-click menu
  This button opens the "New ticket" page using the URL obtained
  from the "server" parameter of GLPI Agent. It also takes a
  screenshot and notifies the user about it and how to attach
  it to the new ticket.

* "View agent logs" button added on main window and right-click menu
  This button opens the GLPI Agent logfile, as configured in
  the "logfile" parameter. It opens the file directly, so it uses
  your system's preferred log file viewer.
