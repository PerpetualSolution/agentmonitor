Revision history for GLPI Agent Monitor


New features for future release

* "New ticket" button added on main window and right-click menu
  This button opens the "New ticket" page using the URL obtained
  from the "server" parameter of GLPI Agent. It also takes a
  screenshot and notifies the user about it and how to attach
  it to the new ticket.

* "View agent logs" button added on main window and right-click menu
  This button opens the GLPI Agent logfile, as configured in
  the "logfile" parameter. It opens the file directly, so it uses
  your system's preferred log file viewer.
